# Computational methods
## Revealing genetic componenets of complex diseases or traits in specific cellular context



We developed a series of bioinformatic tools and computational frameworks to linking genetic risk signals from GWAS summary statistics with single-cell sequencing data, including scPagwas, scHOB, ctDTRF, scRegwas and scDrugHunter.
